## Functional:

List of programming exercises based on http://csbin.io/functional challenges.

### Challenge 1
Create a function `functionValidator` that accepts an array of functions and two different values (let's call them `input` and `output`). This function should return a new array containing *only* the functions from the original array that, when invoked with `input`, return the value `output`. Use reduce!

### Challenge 2
Create a function `allClear` that accepts an array of evaluator functions (each returning a boolean value), and a single value. Using reduce, return a single boolean value indicating whether the value "passes" every single one of the evaluator functions (i.e. returns true).

### Challenge 3
Write a function `numSelectString` that accepts an array of numbers and returns a string. This function should use filter, sort, and reduce to return a string containing only the odd numbers from the array, separated by commas, in ascending order.

### Challenge 4
Write a function `movieSelector` that accepts an array of objects containing movie information (id, title, and score). Chain together invocations of map, filter AND reduce to return an array containing only movies with a score greater than 5. The titles should be all uppercase strings.

### Challenge 5
Create a function `curriedAddThreeNums` that adds three numbers together when run thrice in succession as follows:
```javascript
curriedAddThreeNums(1)(3)(7) //should return 10
```

### Challenge 6
Use partial application with your previously-defined `curriedAddThreeNums` to create a new function `curriedAddTwoNumsToFive` that when run twice in succession, adds two numbers to five as follows:
```javascript
curriedAddTwoNumsToFive(6)(7) //should return 18
```
